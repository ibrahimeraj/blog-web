                    <p class="blogcon">Alcohol addiction is a complicated problem. Meaning that, alcohol can be an addictive substance. But not everyone who consumes alcohol will become addicted. However, certain people may be more susceptible to become addicts. 

                     Alcoholism or alcohol dependency impacts every aspect of a person’s life. An alcoholic suffers mentally, emotionally, and physically. Furthermore, once the addiction takes its toll, almost everyone wants to know how to put an end to this bad habit. It’s just as important to point out that, there is no stereotypical portrait of an alcoholic. Both men and women from all sorts of different economic, education, and racial backgrounds suffer from this problem. If you’re reading this article, chances are that you’re seeking
                
                    <br><br> &emsp; Women, on the other hand, should limit themselves to two to three ounces daily. For men, heavy drinking is typically defined as consuming 15 drinks or more per week. While heavy drinking for women is defined by consuming 8 drinks or more per week.
                
                     Find a support group. In many ways, recovery is an individual experience. Which increases the urge to drink when you’re alone. Progressing through recovery means becoming well-acquainted with your own thought processes and tendencies. Although much of the recovery involves the addict's own individual journey, the value of support systems cannot go underappreciated. 
                
                     A support group, for instance, can help addicts surround themselves with healthy individuals. Meaning that, they’ll gain the ability to end ties with those who have had an unhealthy influence on their life, making the recovery process even more difficult. Support groups can also help addicts voice their struggles. As we all know with any important life change, the road to recovery isn’t always easy. As a matter of fact, anyone who’s battled an addiction knows that you are likely to encounter many obstacles and
                
                     The list can include anything that you hold close to your heart and value. Once the list is made, post it where you can see it daily.<br><br>&emsp;In addition to this, put your focus on enjoying healthier alternatives which don’t involve drinking or being around alcohol. 
                
                     Expect withdrawals to happen. One justification most alcoholics will use for not giving up an addiction is their fear of withdrawals. Approximately 50% of the people with alcohol dependence experience withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms usually start about six hours after alcohol cessation. Even if an individual is cutting back rather than quitting, it’s best to take the process one day at a time. 
                
                     From the first six hours to a few weeks after the last drink, drinkers that range from medium to heavy will experience withdrawal symptoms that include:

                    &emsp;By ending alcohol consumption, individuals may also experience an increase in energy level. After a few months, excess weight begins to disappear as the result of lower calorie intake. Although most of us may not realize it, liquor, especially beer, adds up to a lot of calories and can easily add punds to your body.</p>
